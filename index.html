            You need to feed your Tamagotchi so they dont go hungry! But be careful as when you eat you tend to get sleepy as well. 
        </p>
    <h2 id="sleepiness"></h2>
        <p>
            Sleep is extremely important to the survival of your pet. Dont let this number reach 10 as your pet could faint!
        </p>
    <h2 id="boredom"></h2>
        <p>
            Just like real pets your Tamagotchi needs exercise in order to stay happy and to decrease your boredom. But be careful as it will also make your pet more hungry!
        </p>
    <h2 id="age"></h2>
        <p>
            As you age your Tamagotchi will <em>Evolve</em> into a stronger being. See how far you can make it!
